# Reporting Security Issues

The Prompt Engineering project prioritizes security in AI-assisted reviews, emphasizing rigorous identification and 
mitigation of vulnerabilities in code, prompts, and deliverables. We value responsible disclosure to maintain high 
standards of integrity and safety.

To report a security issue—such as flaws in review logic, or vulnerabilities in supporting code—use the GitHub 
Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/SebGSX/Prompt-Engineering/security/advisories/new) tab.

Please may you provide detailed information, including reproduction steps, affected components (e.g., specific 
prompts or code modules), potential impacts on security or maintainability, and any evidence from testing with AI 
models.

The maintainers will respond promptly, outlining next steps, and keep you updated on progress toward resolution. We 
may request additional details to ensure thorough validation.

For security issues in third-party dependencies or AI models referenced in prompts, report directly to the 
respective maintainers or providers.
