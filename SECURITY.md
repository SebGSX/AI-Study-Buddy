# Reporting Security Issues

The team prioritizes security emphasizing rigorous identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities in code, prompts,
and deliverables. We value responsible disclosure to maintain high standards of integrity and safety.

To report a security issueâ€”such as flaws, please use the GitHub Security
Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/SebGSX/AI-Study-Buddy/security/advisories/new) tab.

Please may you provide detailed information, including reproduction steps, affected components (e.g., specific
prompts or code modules), potential impacts on security or maintainability, and any evidence from testing with AI
models or other dependencies.

The maintainers will respond promptly, outlining next steps, and keep you updated on progress toward resolution. We
may request additional details to ensure thorough validation.

For security issues in third-party dependencies or AI models referenced in prompts, report directly to the
respective maintainers or providers.
